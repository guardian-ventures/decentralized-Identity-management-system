A self sovereign Identity Management System which established a model of decentralized and unique digital identities where an individual doesn't
need to create multiple identities with various centralized third party websites or applications like Facebook, Amazon, Flipkart etc. The identities along
with the essential details of the users are stored in an InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) network, and the content address of the identity is stored in
an ethereum blockchain through smart contracts. The identities of the users are verified and signed by a proper trusted authority before adding to the
blockchain and IPFS. This allows the users to authenticate themselves to third parties without having to create multiple centralized identities.
